# JugglingPatternNotes

Programming Pattern
Martens one count
6 clubs one passer starts with two the other passer starts with for
one passer throws straights the other passer throws diagonal
the passer with 4 starts with pass, pass, pass, pass, zip
the passer with 2 starts with pause, pass, pass, pass, pass, zip

parsnips pass, pass, zip, pass, zip
straights and diagonals

funky bookends
pass, pass, self, pass, heff

going from martens one count to funky bookends forces the other passer into parsnips and you can go back into martens at any point

Why are you following me?
6 person passing pattern with manipulation
A B C
  D
  E 
  F
  
The Y pattern involves A, C, D, F
Manipulators are B and E


A does pass to F, Pass to F, pass to F, flip, Give to new A
B has one club, waits for C to pass to F, intercepts the next pass and replaces, gets pilf from C and replaces C
C does, pass, pass intercepted by B, pilf B, flip deliver to D, get pilf from D and turn around becoming D
D does  pass, get pass on shoulder, pass intercepted by E, pilf C, turn around become E
E waits for first pass, get pilf from F, turn replace F and pass to C
F passer does pass to C pilf E, flip, place club on shoulder of D, run to A
