# JugglingPatternNotes

Programming Pattern
Martens one count
6 clubs one passer starts with two the other passer starts with for
one passer throws straights the other passer throws diagonal
the passer with 4 starts with pass, pass, pass, pass, zip
the passer with 2 starts with pause, pass, pass, pass, pass, zip

parsnips pass, pass, zip, pass, zip
straights and diagonals

funky bookends
pass, pass, self, pass, heff

going from martens one count to funky bookends forces the other passer into parsnips and you can go back into martens at any point
